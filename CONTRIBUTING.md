# Contributing

We’re really happy to accept contributions from the community, that’s the main reason why we open-sourced it! There are many ways to contribute, even if you’re not a technical person.

We’re using the infamous [simplified Github workflow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) to accept modifications (even internally), basically you’ll have to:

* create an issue related to the problem you want to fix (good for traceability and cross-reference)
* fork the repository
* create a branch (optionally with the reference to the issue in the name)
* hack hack hack
* commit incrementally with readable and detailed commit messages
* submit a pull-request against the master branch of this repository

We’ll take care of tagging your issue with the appropriated labels and answer within a week (hopefully less!) to the problem you encounter.

If you’re not familiar with open-source workflows or our set of technologies, do not hesitate to ask for help! We can mentor you or propose good first bugs (as labeled in our issues). Also welcome to add your name to Credits section of this document.

## Submitting bugs

You can report issues directly on Github, that would be a really useful contribution given that we lack some user testing on the project. Please document as much as possible the steps to reproduce your problem (even better with screenshots).
